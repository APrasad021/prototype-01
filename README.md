Idea for UI:

- Site initializes (fade in)
- There are circles that subtly drift that signify an initial mode for application usage
    - "Search" is selected
- The users searches that they want to "Watch a movie"
- The top actions shown are based on their previous offline library actions + library
- The user toggles on connection to the Internet
- The UI reloads and shows top actions including their online library
- They select the top choice, which is to continue streaming a movie they didn't complete
    - They use Airplay to play it on their TV and their phone to be the TV's remote
- They then search about research pertaining to "{Topic TBD}"
    - The application changes modes from entertainment to learning
- They get the key learning of their query via an AI agent that allows them to export it to their own database
- Option to review previous studying material in the top choices
- After that, the user types in "build" and a hotbar of creative applications are shown for the user to choose from
- After building, the user uses a less than 5 click shopping experience
